# Requirements
* Make sure [pivmat](http://www.fast.u-psud.fr/pivmat/) is installed so that the `loadvec` function works.
* Also make sure that the `/FSSS` folder has the file `intgrad2.m` downloaded from the [MATLAB file exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9734-inverse-integrated-gradient?s_tid=srchtitle).

# Usage
* For image preprocessing please see the files in `/Image Preprocessing`.
* For OpenPIV please run `/OpenPIV/OpenPIV.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook.
* For FSSS, please run `/FSSS/plotgeneral`.
